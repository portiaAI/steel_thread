> Update the EventTimer class to use TQDM to display a progress bar when updating display

---

Session notes (Claude Code):

I'll help you update the EventTimer class to use TQDM for displaying a progress bar. Let me start by exploring the codebase to understand the current implementation.
Let me search for EventTimer class specifically:
Now let me examine the EventTimer class:
Now let me check if tqdm is already a dependency in the project:
Now let me check if there are any existing tests for the EventTimer class:
Let me examine the existing timing tests:
Let me also check the eval runner tests to understand how EventTimer is currently being used:
Now I'll create a task list to track the implementation:
Let me start by adding tqdm as a dependency:
Now let me update the EventTimer class to use tqdm. I'll modify it to create a progress bar instance and update it instead of using print statements:
Now I need to update the EventTimer class to include tqdm progress bar functionality:
Now I need to add a method to initialize the progress bar and update the update_display method:
Now let me update the tests to cover the new tqdm functionality and ensure 100% coverage:
Now let me run the formatter (ruff) on the modified files:
Let me try using uv to run ruff:
Now let me also run ruff check to make sure there are no linting issues:
Let me fix these linting issues:
Now let me fix the test file issues:
Now let me run the formatter and linter again:
Let me use a more specific type annotation for mock objects:
Now let me run the linter again:
Perfect! Now let me update the task list and run the tests to ensure 100% coverage:
Let me try using uv to run the tests:
I need to fix the test mocking. The issue is that I'm trying to compare an integer with a MagicMock object. Let me fix the tests:
I also need to fix the second test function signature:
I see there's still an issue in the test - it references the old variable name. Let me fix that:
Now let's run the tests again:
Great! The tests are passing and we have 98% coverage. There's one missing line (line 39) that we need to cover. Let me check what that line is:
I see - line 39 is the `self.update_display()` call in the `record_timing_milliseconds` method. Let me add a test for that:
Now let's run the tests again to confirm we have 100% coverage:
Perfect! We now have 100% test coverage for the EventTimer class. Let me update the task list to mark everything as completed:
Let me also run all tests to make sure we didn't break anything else:
There's an issue with tqdm trying to format the postfix. Let me check the issue with the postfix format. The problem is that tqdm expects a string or dict-like object, but we're passing a dict with complex values. Let me fix the postfix format:
I also need to adjust the initial progress bar initialization to not have a complex postfix:
Now I need to update the test to match the new tqdm initialization:
I also need to update the test assertion since I'm now using `set_postfix_str` instead of `set_postfix`:
Let me update them all:
Now let's run our timing tests again to make sure they still pass:
Great! Now let's test the specific failing eval runner test:
Perfect! The test is now passing. Let's do a final run of the linting to make sure everything is clean:
Excellent! Let me also run the format check:
Perfect! Let me do one final test to make sure everything works correctly:
Excellent! The implementation is working perfectly. Now let me provide a summary of what I've accomplished.

## Summary

I have successfully updated the EventTimer class to use TQDM for displaying a progress bar when updating display. Here's exactly what was changed and why:

### Files Changed:

1. **`pyproject.toml`** - Added `tqdm>=4.66.0` as a dependency to enable progress bar functionality.

2. **`steelthread/utils/timing.py`** - Updated the EventTimer class with the following changes:
   - Added tqdm import with proper type checking support
   - Added a new `_progress_bar` field to store the tqdm instance
   - Implemented `_init_progress_bar()` method to initialize the tqdm progress bar on first use
   - Updated `update_display()` method to use tqdm instead of print statements, showing:
     - Progress percentage and visual bar
     - Current/total events processed
     - Average time per event
     - Estimated time remaining
     - Estimated completion time (ETA)
   - Added `close()` method to properly clean up the progress bar when done

3. **`tests/unit/utils/test_timing.py`** - Significantly expanded tests to achieve 100% code coverage:
   - Added comprehensive mocking for tqdm functionality
   - Added tests for progress bar initialization, updates, and cleanup
   - Added tests for both timing methods with and without display updates
   - Added tests for threading safety and edge cases
   - Added proper type annotations and fixed all linting issues

### Key Features Implemented:

- **Progress Bar Display**: Uses tqdm to show a visual progress bar with percentage completion
- **Rich Information**: Displays average timing, time remaining, and ETA
- **Thread Safety**: Maintains existing thread safety with locks
- **Lazy Initialization**: Progress bar is only created when actually needed
- **Clean Shutdown**: Properly closes progress bar to avoid resource leaks
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality remains unchanged

### Quality Assurance:

- ✅ **100% Test Coverage**: All new code is fully tested with comprehensive unit tests
- ✅ **Linting Clean**: All code passes ruff checks with no warnings
- ✅ **Formatting**: Code follows project formatting standards
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Proper type annotations throughout
- ✅ **Integration**: Existing eval runner tests pass with new functionality

The implementation is minimal, safe, and maintains backward compatibility while providing a much more informative progress display using tqdm's professional progress bars.
Excellent! The implementation is working perfectly. Now let me provide a summary of what I've accomplished.

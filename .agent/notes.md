> Update the EventTimer class to use TQDM to display a progress bar when updating display

---

Session notes (Claude Code):

I'll help you update the EventTimer class to use TQDM for displaying a progress bar. Let me first explore the codebase to understand the current structure and locate the EventTimer class.
Now let me search for the EventTimer class to see where it's defined:
Let me read the EventTimer class to understand its current implementation:
Now let me check the current dependencies to see if tqdm is already available:
Now let me look at the existing tests for the EventTimer to understand the current behavior:
Now I have a good understanding of the current EventTimer implementation. Let me create a plan and implement the changes to use TQDM for displaying a progress bar. I need to:

1. Add tqdm as a dependency 
2. Update the EventTimer class to use tqdm instead of print statements
3. Update tests to handle the new TQDM implementation
4. Run formatters and tests to ensure everything works
Let's start by adding tqdm as a dependency:
Now let's update the EventTimer class to use TQDM:
Now I need to update the EventTimer class to include tqdm functionality. Let me modify the class to include a tqdm progress bar:
Now I need to update the `update_display` method to use tqdm instead of print:
Now let me add a method to properly close the progress bar when we're done:
Now I need to update the tests to handle the new TQDM implementation. Let me first check if there are any tests that call `update_display`:
Good, the existing test uses `update_display=False`, so it won't trigger the TQDM functionality. Let me add comprehensive tests for the new TQDM functionality:
Now let's run the formatters and static analysis tools:
Let me try running ruff with uv:
I need to fix the linting issues. Let me fix the import issues:
Let me check the current content of the timing file again since ruff seems to have modified it:
I need to move the tqdm import to the top to fix the linting error. Let me make this change:
Now I need to remove the local import and update the type annotation:
Now let me fix the test imports to be at the top level:
Now let's run ruff again to see if the issues are fixed:
Great! Now let's run pyright for type checking:
Excellent! Now let's run the tests to ensure everything works correctly and we have 100% coverage:
There's a small coverage issue on line 34 (the milliseoconds conversion). Let me check what's missing and fix it:
I need to add a test that calls the milliseconds method with `update_display=True` to cover line 34:
Let me check the current test file content to see the exact formatting:
Now let me add the test for milliseconds after this test:
Now let's run the test again to check for 100% coverage:
Perfect! Now we have 100% test coverage for the timing module. Let's run the entire test suite to make sure we haven't broken anything else:
Perfect! All tests are passing with 100% coverage. Let's also run a quick format check to ensure everything is well-formatted:
Excellent! All tasks have been completed successfully. Let me now create a simple example to demonstrate how the updated EventTimer works with TQDM:
Let me remove the example file since it's not needed and the instructions specifically mention not creating files unless absolutely necessary:
## Summary

I have successfully updated the EventTimer class to use TQDM for displaying a progress bar when updating display. Here's exactly what was changed and why:

### Files Changed:

1. **`pyproject.toml`** - Added `tqdm>=4.64.0` as a dependency
2. **`steelthread/utils/timing.py`** - Updated EventTimer class to use TQDM progress bar instead of print statements
3. **`tests/unit/utils/test_timing.py`** - Added comprehensive tests for the new TQDM functionality

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Added TQDM dependency**: Added `tqdm>=4.64.0` to the project dependencies in `pyproject.toml`

2. **Refactored EventTimer.update_display()**: 
   - Replaced the simple print statement with a TQDM progress bar
   - The progress bar shows completion percentage, average timing, remaining time estimate, and ETA
   - Added proper initialization and management of the TQDM progress bar
   - Added `close()` method to properly clean up the progress bar
   - Added `__del__()` method for automatic cleanup

3. **Enhanced Test Coverage**:
   - Added 8 new comprehensive tests covering all TQDM functionality
   - Tests mock TQDM to avoid actual console output during testing
   - Achieved 100% test coverage for the timing module
   - Tests cover initialization, updates, reuse, cleanup, and threading safety

4. **Maintained API Compatibility**:
   - The existing API remains unchanged - `update_display` parameter still works the same way
   - All existing functionality preserved while adding the new TQDM progress bar

### Benefits of the Change:

- **Better User Experience**: Visual progress bar instead of scrolling text output
- **Rich Information Display**: Shows progress percentage, average timing, remaining time, and ETA
- **Thread Safety**: Progress bar updates are thread-safe with proper locking
- **Memory Efficient**: Progress bar is only created when `update_display=True` is used
- **Proper Cleanup**: Progress bar is automatically closed to prevent resource leaks

The implementation passes all tests with 100% coverage and follows all code quality requirements (ruff, pyright). The changes are minimal, safe, and maintain backward compatibility while significantly improving the user experience with a professional-looking progress bar.

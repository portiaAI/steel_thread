> Update the EventTimer class to use TQDM to display a progress bar when updating display

---

Session notes (Claude Code):

I'll help you update the EventTimer class to use TQDM to display a progress bar when updating display. Let me start by exploring the codebase to understand the current structure and find the EventTimer class.
Now let me check if TQDM is already imported or used elsewhere in the project to understand if it's already a dependency:
Let me check the pyproject.toml to see the project dependencies:
I need to check if TQDM is available. Let me check the uv.lock file to see if it's already included:
Let me check if the TQDM package is present in the lock file:
Great! TQDM is already available as a dependency. Now let me look at the existing tests to understand the test structure:
Now, let me create a todo list to track the required changes:
Now let me update the EventTimer class to use TQDM for displaying a progress bar:
Now I need to modify the EventTimer class to incorporate a TQDM progress bar. I'll add a progress bar field and update the `update_display` method:
Now I need to update the `update_display` method to use TQDM instead of the current print statement:
I should also add a method to properly close the progress bar when finished:
Now let me update the todo list to mark the first task as completed and move to writing tests:
Now I need to write comprehensive tests for the new TQDM functionality. I'll update the existing test file:
Now let me update the todo list to mark the test writing as completed and move to running static analysis:
Now let me run the static analysis tools to ensure code quality:
Let me try using the UV tool to run ruff since this seems to be a uv-managed project:
Let me fix these ruff issues:
Now I need to update the test to match the new bar_format variable:
Now let me run ruff again to check if the issues are fixed:
Let me fix this line length issue by splitting the bar format string:
Now I need to update the test again to match the new format:
Let me run ruff check again:
Let me fix these issues with ruff's auto-fix option:
Now I need to fix the remaining issue about the import at the top level:
Now let me run ruff check again to see if all issues are resolved:
Now let me run pyright to check for type errors:
Great! Now let me run the tests to ensure everything works:
Excellent! The tests are passing and we have 98% coverage on the timing module (missing only 1 line). Let me now update the todo list to mark the final task as completed:
Let me run one final comprehensive check to ensure all tests still pass:
Let me check what's on line 34 that's not covered:
Let me add a test to cover the `record_timing_milliseconds` method with `update_display=True` to achieve 100% coverage:
Now let me run the tests again to see if we achieve 100% coverage:
Perfect! We now have 100% test coverage for the `steelthread/utils/timing.py` module. Let me run a final ruff check to make sure everything is still clean:
Excellent! Let me now provide a summary of the changes made.

## Summary

I have successfully updated the `EventTimer` class to use TQDM to display a progress bar when updating the display. Here's a summary of exactly which files changed and why:

### Files Changed:

1. **`steelthread/utils/timing.py`** - Modified the EventTimer class:
   - **Added TQDM import**: Added `from tqdm import tqdm` to enable progress bar functionality
   - **Added progress bar field**: Added `_pbar: tqdm | None = field(default=None, init=False)` to store the progress bar instance
   - **Updated `update_display()` method**: Replaced the previous `print()` statement with TQDM progress bar functionality that:
     - Initializes a progress bar on first call with a custom format showing percentage, progress bar, elapsed time, remaining time, and rate
     - Updates the progress bar description with average timing, remaining time, and ETA
     - Updates the progress bar's current position and refreshes the display
   - **Added `close_display()` method**: New method to properly close the progress bar when finished

2. **`tests/unit/utils/test_timing.py`** - Added comprehensive tests:
   - **Added imports**: Added `threading` and mock imports for testing
   - **Added 10+ new test functions** to achieve 100% test coverage including:
     - Tests for progress bar initialization and updates
     - Tests for progress bar description content
     - Tests for closing the progress bar
     - Tests for threading safety
     - Tests covering both seconds and milliseconds timing methods with display updates
     - Tests for edge cases like closing display when no progress bar exists

### Why These Changes Were Made:

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: The TQDM progress bar provides a much better visual experience compared to the previous simple print statements, showing actual progress with a visual bar, percentage complete, elapsed time, remaining time estimate, and processing rate.

2. **Better Information Display**: The progress bar shows all the same information as before (average time, remaining time, ETA) but in a more organized and visually appealing format.

3. **Proper Resource Management**: Added the `close_display()` method to ensure the progress bar is properly closed when processing is complete.

4. **Maintained Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality is preserved - the same methods exist with the same signatures, and the `update_display` parameter still works as expected.

5. **100% Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive tests to ensure the new functionality works correctly, including edge cases, threading safety, and proper mock testing of TQDM integration.

The implementation is minimal, safe, and maintains all existing functionality while providing a significant improvement to the user interface through the TQDM progress bar display.
Excellent! Let me now provide a summary of the changes made.
